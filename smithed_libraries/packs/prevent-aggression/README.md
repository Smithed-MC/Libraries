# Prevent Agression

Every 10 ticks (0.5 seconds), hostile mobs that attack villagers are added to the smithed.prevent_aggression team. Entities with the smithed.entity tag are ignored, but can be added to the team with a separate command.
All mobs that naturally attack villagers are added to the team by default:

- zombie
- husk
- drowned
- zombie_villager
- pillager
- ravager
- vindicator
- vex
- illusioner
